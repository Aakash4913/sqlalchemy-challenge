# sqlalchemy-challenge


In this challenge, We are trying to do a climate analysis about Honolulu, where we want to go on vacation.
We use stations and the measurements at each station to see what the temperature is like and for how many 
days, and create graphs using Jupyters notebook.

After that, we make an API website that links to SQLite and tells us what we want to know.
